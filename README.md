Implementation of Manuel Kiessling Node beginner book content.

I have started to learn and explore Node. So, I'm following Manuel Kiessling book for this purpose.

The main purpose of this repository is to code/practice the content of node mentioned in the book.


# A full blown web application with Node.js

-- The use cases <br/>
Let’s keep it simple, but realistic:<br/>
• The user should be able to use our application with a web browser. <br/>
• The user should see a welcome page when requesting http://localhost:8888/start which displays a file upload form. <br/>
• By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the form, this image should then be uploaded to http://localhost:8888/upload, where it is displayed once the upload is finished
